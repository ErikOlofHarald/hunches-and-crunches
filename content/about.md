Throughout the years I have stumbled upon countless blogs and tutorials pitching in to explain a tiny scratch of what is going on in the the field known as Data Science, or whatever you want to call it. Sometimes by an absent click, other times in hope of finding an answer to a specific question. Regardless the purpose or if I found what I was looking for, it has been of immense help and it is almost always useful to get somebody else's take on things. So this is my contribution, I hope someone, sometime, somewhere, might get something out of it!

This website was built using `blogdown` and Hugo. The theme is by [Jeffprod](https://en.jeffprod.com/), but has been slightly, and haphazardly, modified to suit my own style and taste.

Notebooks, code and data can be found in [this github repository](https://github.com/ErikOlofHarald/hunches-and-crunches)
